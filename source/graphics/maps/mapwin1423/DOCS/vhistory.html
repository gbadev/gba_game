<h3>Version History</h3>

<p>&nbsp;<strong>1.4.23</strong><br>
Fixed getObjectFilename not working unless Textstrings were loaded<br>
Added getLayerName to get the name of a layer<br>
Added holding shift key scrolls ten blocks when arrow keys are pressed<br>
Removed geocities references<br>
Added Show lower layers to onionskin options<br>
Added Object Layer field to show info on tiles (This associates objects with<br>
a layer and only shows it on the layer specified in a user field).<br>
Mousewheel now scrolls the window the mouse is over<br>

<p>&nbsp;<strong>1.4.22</strong><br>
Placer.lua can now smooth as you draw the map (see quickstart docs)<br>
Area.lua now places a solid rectangle of blocks<br>
Layers increased to 100<br>
Layers can be named (shown in map window titlebar)<br>
The tl,tr,bl,br field labels can now be set<br>
Pro: Fixed drag map and block coords<br>
Fixed too long labels<br>
Fixed wrong block diplayed on onionskin when flag1 is set on block<br>
Onionskin can edit layer when not at front<br>
Pro: Unselected object show text in bordercolour property<br>
Pro: Object user values can be displayed with show user info<br>
mappy.setValue (mappy.MAPFILENAME, "") now updates the titlebar<br>
Lua: mappy.renameLayer (LAYERNUM, "Name") added<br>

<p>&nbsp;<strong>1.4.21</strong><br>
Reverted to lua 5.0.3 due to a possible bug in lua 5.1 (used in mapwin1420):<br>
  It appears numbers are rounded to nearest whole number in 5.1 meaning scripts<br>
  using writeIntLSB (Export binary file.lua etc) wrote incorrect files<br>
  See the tilemap.co.uk forum for more details<br>
If a lua script has an error, this will now be shown (thanks Merick)<br>
Corrected the lua docs for mappy.setValue()<br>
Fixed lua mappy.moveWindow()<br>
You can set the dividers from lua with get/setValue (mappy.MAPDIVIDERS, ONOFF, X, Y, COLOUR)<br>
  ONOFF is 0 or 1, COLOUR is an RGB value (if using getValue, these are returned)<br>

<p>&nbsp;<strong>1.4.20</strong><br>
Fixed crash when User info is shown with 3D walls (wnesmode)<br>
Added 3D walls mode to MapTools menu (wnesmode)<br>

Pro: Custom mousebuttons now work in Graphics editor (block0=colour0, pick, fill, line)<br>
Pro: Drag map now works in Object editor<br>
Fixed user info display length can now be changed<br>
Compiled with latest mingw, lua (5.1.2) and libpng (1.2.24)<br>
Keys i, k and m can be customised in mapwin.ini (keyi, keyk and keym)<br>
ctrl-x or Edit cut can now display a warning with 'warnctrlx=1' in mapwin.ini<br>

<p>&nbsp;<strong>1.4.19</strong><br>
32bit FMPS now have true alphablend (use onionskin or move graphics from BG to FG field 
with 'range edit blocks')<br>
Fixed several lua dialogue functions<br>
Overlap maps (where stagger is 0x0, but blockgap is different from blocksize) now 
work properly (use onionskin on a blank layer for transparent overlap), disable 
grid for less depth sort artifacts<br>
'Grab Brush from block sequence' works better, size the Block Window so the area is
aligned, select the top left block, then select the bottom right block, then select
'Grab Brush from block sequence' in the Brushes menu and accept the defaults.<br>

<p>&nbsp;<strong>1.4.18</strong><br>
Fixed object drag bug<br>

the top of mappygl.c<br>

Added TEST2.FMP map<br>

(This now means changing grid in menu or Ctrl+g toggles between 3 styles)<br>

New import style (to revert to old style, change 'importskip = 1' in mapwin.ini)

blocks thereon are imported until all following blocks are black)<br>

You can now use flipped tiles (change 'flippedtiles = 1' in mapwin.ini)<br>
IMPORTANT: You must set 'flippedtiles = 0' to work with isometric pillar maps,
flipped tiles are also unsupported by the playback libraries and anim preview
and are mainly for GameBoy developers.<br>
